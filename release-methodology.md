# Release methodology

Releases are hierarchically: Major, Minor and Build. They are named in syntax “Productname x.yy.zzz” where x is major, y is minor and z is build number.

The project steering group that is lead by projct owner approves Major versions. Product Manager approves Minor versions when so favored by the Technical board. A new build number is assigned every time an increment of the software is committed to the public repository for testing.
